# Linux-Unix-Command-Line-Notes
A CherryTree notebook full of Linux/Unix commands for anyone just learning how to use the Linux command line. 
I'll be updating it as much as possible. 

Information comes from my class and Cisco's Netacad.

If anything is incorrect or you would like the notes in a different format, please let me know.

This is, by no means, an exhaustive list. I'm just hoping to get together commands that are used the most often, especially for beginner users.
