# Linux-Unix-Command-Line-Notes
A CherryTree notebook full of Linux/Unix commands for anyone just learning how to use the Linux command line. 
I'll be updating it as much as possible. 

Information comes from my class and Cisco's Netacad.

If anything shows is incorrect, please let me know. If you would like the notes in a different format, let me know.

This is, by no means, an exhaustive list. I'm just hoping to get together commands that are used the most often, especially for beginner users.
